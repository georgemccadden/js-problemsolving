/* 
PROBLEM DOMAIN :

Given a string, determine how many palindromic substrings are present.

Edge Cases -> 

- Palindromes can be counted even if they consist of the same characters.
- Input strings' length cannot exceed 1000 characters
- Single characters are considered palindromes


EXAMPLE 1 :

Input -> `abc`
Output -> 3
Explanation -> There are three palindromic strings: `a`, `b`, `c`

EXAMPLE 2 :

Input -> `aaa`
Output -> 6
Explanation -> There are six palindromic strings: `a`, `a`, `a`, `aa`, `aa`, `aaa`
