// ** PROBLEM DOMAIN :

// Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. These are the constraints ->
// - You may assume that each input would have exactly ONE solution
// - You may not use the same element twice
// - There must be at least two elements
