/*

PROBLEM DOMAIN :

Given an array of numbers, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.


EXAMPLE :

Input -> [0,1,0,3,12]
Output -> [1,3,12,0,0]
Explanation -> All of the zeros were moved to the end of the array without changing the order of the non-zero elements (and its the same array, not a copy).
