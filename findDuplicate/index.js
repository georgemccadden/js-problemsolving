/*

PROBLEM DOMAIN :

Given an array of integers, nums, containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

(An array is best for accessing elements by index in O(1) time but for searching, inserting, and deleting it is inefficient and takes O(n) time)
