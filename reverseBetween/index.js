/*
PROBLEM DOMAIN :
Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers "m" and "n" where "m" <= "n", reverse the nodes of the list from position "m" to position "n", and return the reversed list.

TEST CASES :

Input -> head = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, m = 2, n = 4
Output -> {1, 4, 3, 2, 5}

Input -> head = {5}, m = 1, n = 1
Output -> {5}
