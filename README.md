# Problem Solving using Javascript

This repository will house complex problems in the programming language of JavaScript.

## Big O (Runtime Complexity) :

`O(1)` __Constant Time__ -> There are no loops.

`O(log n)` __Logarithmic Time__ -> Most likely a search algorithm will have this runtime if they are sorted, such as binary search although not on hashmaps.

`O(n)` __Linear Time__ -> For loops and while loops.

`O(n * log(n))` __Logarithmic Linear Time__ -> Most likely sorting operations.

`O(n^2)` __Quadratic Time__ -> Every element in a collection needs to be compared to every other element, meaning two nested loops.

`O(2^n)` __Exponential Time__ -> Most likely recursive algorithms which solve a problem size `n`.

`O(n!)` __Factorial Time__ -> A loop is being added for each element.
