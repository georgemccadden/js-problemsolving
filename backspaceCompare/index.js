PROBLEM DOMAIN :
Given two strings "s" and "t", return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character. Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.


TEST CASES :
Input -> s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output -> true
Explanation -> Both s and t become "ac".

Input -> s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output -> true
Explanation -> Both s and t become "".

Input -> s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output -> false
Explanation -> s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".

Input -> s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output -> false
