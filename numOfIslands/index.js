/*
PROBLEM DOMAIN :

Given a 2D grid map of `L`s (land) and `~`s (water), return the number of  islands.

(note / An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water)


EXAMPLE 1 :

Input -> 
grid = 
[
    [`L`, `L`, `L`, `L`, `~`],
    [`L`, `L`, `~`, `L`, `~`],
    [`L`, `L`, `~`, `~`, `~`],
    [`~`, `~`, `~`, `~`, `~`]
]
Output -> 1
